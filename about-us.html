					<h1>About us</h1>
					<p>Hello and Salaam everyone! We are a university working group focused on creating a safe and
						inclusive space, specifically for South Asian Muslims and our allies.
						This is meant to be an organization where students from diverse backgrounds can come together on
						shared Islamic and humanitarian values of equity, justice, mercy,
						compassion, respect, and solidarity. We welcome <strong>all Muslims, regardless of sect, country
							of origin, ethnicity, caste, gender, sexuality, ability, and all South Asians
							as well as allies.</strong> (In other words, if you identify with South Asia and/or Islam in
						any way,
						and/or are interested in learning more about Islam/the diverse cultures of
						the region, we welcome you to our community.
					</p>

					<p>
						We accept and acknowledge our religious/ethnic differences in their entirety; South Asia is a
						vast multicultural, multilingual, and religiously diverse region with a rich history.
						Thus, we invite folks who may have cultural ties to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
						Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka; in communities in Fiji, the Caribbean (Grenada, Guyana,
						Saint Lucia, Martinique, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad, and
						Tobago), Mauritius, South Africa; as well as communities participating in self-determination
						movements
						in Balochistan, Kashmir, Nagaland, and elsewhere.
					</p>

					<p>
						We came together in the fall of 2021 as an independent working group and are currently supported
						by Other Collective, a media platform aimed at reclaiming, amplifying, and centering
						marginalized Southwest
						Asian, South Asian, and North African identities. You can support our programming work at SAM
						UWG by signing up for the specific tier on our Patreon @Other Collective Media.
					</p>

				<h2>Statement from our Community</h2>
				<blockquote>We would like to once again stress the importance about how our organization recognizes
					and appreciates diversity within the South Asian Muslim context; we are all from different
					backgrounds and focus on what each one of us can contribute as an individual shaped by our
					own unique life experiences. We value each person as a whole and remain firm in our belief
					of being non judgemental. At the end of the day, every Muslim has their own relationship with
					Allah (SWT) and is in their own religious journey. We respect one anotherâ€™s beliefs and do not
					claim to represent Islam in any way (for all of you haram police out there). We are simply a
					group of students working to support each other in this vast world during these unpredictable
					times, making a safe space for each other and others along the way. We hope to raise awareness
					about injustices committed by and against those in our collective community, and we hope that
					you can join us on our journey.
